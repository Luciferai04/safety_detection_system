## üìû **RECOMMENDATION**

**DO NOT DEPLOY** the current model in thermal power plant production environments without significant enhancements. The accuracy is too low and critical safety equipment detection is missing.

**RECOMMENDED PATH**: Implement the comprehensive enhancement plan provided, with particular focus on arc flash detection for electrical safety areas.

**TIMELINE TO PRODUCTION**: 3-4 months with proper investment in data collection and model enhancement.
