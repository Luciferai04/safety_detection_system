## Deployment Phases

### Phase 1: Pilot Deployment (Week 1-2)
1. Deploy in control room area (lowest risk)
2. Test basic detection accuracy
3. Validate alert system
4. Train operators on interface

### Phase 2: Critical Areas (Week 3-4)
1. Deploy in switchyard (highest priority)
2. Configure arc flash detection rules
3. Integrate with electrical safety systems
4. Test emergency protocols

### Phase 3: Full Plant (Week 5-8)
1. Deploy across all areas
2. Implement area-specific rules
3. Integrate with plant operations
4. Full operator training

## Configuration for Different Areas

### Boiler Area
```yaml
area: "boiler_area"
required_ppe: ["helmet", "reflective_jacket", "safety_boots", "safety_gloves"]
environmental_adaptations:
 steam_compensation: true
 heat_shimmer_correction: true
alert_level: "medium"
```

### Switchyard
```yaml
area: "switchyard"
required_ppe: ["helmet", "reflective_jacket", "safety_boots", "arc_flash_suit"]
mandatory_ppe: ["arc_flash_suit"]
alert_level: "critical"
immediate_action: "stop_work"
```

### Coal Handling
```yaml
area: "coal_handling"
required_ppe: ["helmet", "reflective_jacket", "safety_boots", "respirator"]
environmental_adaptations:
 dust_compensation: true
air_quality_monitoring: true
```

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
- Detection accuracy per area
- False positive/negative rates
- Response time to violations
- Operator compliance rates
- System uptime

### Recommended Thresholds
- Detection accuracy: ≥90%
- False positive rate: ≤5%
- Alert response time: ≤30 seconds
- System availability: ≥99.5%

## Safety Considerations

### Critical Safety Rules
1. Never disable safety detection without proper authorization
2. Always have backup operators during system maintenance
3. Test emergency protocols monthly
4. Maintain visual backup systems
5. Regular accuracy validation with known scenarios

### Emergency Procedures
1. System failure → Immediate manual safety oversight
2. Critical violation → Work stoppage protocol
3. Multiple violations → Area evacuation
4. Equipment malfunction → Failover to backup systems
